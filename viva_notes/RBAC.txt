1. What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 

 Role-Based Access Control, commonly known as RBAC,
 it is a method of managing access to SQL databases by defining and assigning roles to users or groups of users. 
These roles grant specific permissions and privileges to users, which ultimately simplifies the administration of database security.


2.   How does RBAC work in SQL databases?


as said 
first we start by creating roles and associating these roles with database objects and permissions.

Users are then assigned to these roles, allowing them to inherit the associated permissions. This approach simplifies security management, as administrators can modify role permissions instead of individual user permissions.


Data Control Language (DCL) - it the administrative tasks of controlling the database itself, most notably granting and revoking database permissions for users

. In SQL, this corresponds to the GRANT, REVOKE, and DENY commands, among others.



3. key components of RBAC in SQL?

Roles: These are named collections of permissions, often representing specific job functions or responsibilities.

Permissions: These define what actions a role or user is allowed to perform on specific database objects.

Users: Individuals who interact with the database and are assigned to roles.

Privileges: Database objects, like tables or views, that are subject to access control.


4.   What are the advantages of using RBAC in SQL?

Simplified Management: It simplifies access control by centralizing permissions within roles, making it easier to maintain and modify access rights.

Granular Control: Administrators can define fine-grained permissions, limiting access to specific data or actions.

Scalability: It easily scales with the addition of new users and roles, maintaining security while the organization grows.

Security: It enhances security by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
