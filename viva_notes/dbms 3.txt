What is Normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.

Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.

1nf 

Data Integrity or atomic values
Simplicity


2nf

Eliminating Partial Dependencies:ensuring that all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key, you avoid redundancy and data anomalies.

Simplifying Querying:
It helps avoid complex joins and calculations due to redundant data.


3nf

Eliminating Transitive Dependencies: 
ensures data integrity and reduces the risk of update anomalies.

Improving Maintainability: 
 making it easier to update, modify, and extend the database without introducing anomalies or inconsistencies.

A stronger definition of 3NF is known as Boyce Codd's normal form.


Disadvantages of Normalization
You cannot start building the database before knowing what the user needs.
The performance degrades when normalizing the relations to higher normal forms, i.e., 4NF, 5NF.
It is very time-consuming and difficult to normalize relations of a higher degree.
